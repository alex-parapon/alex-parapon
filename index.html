<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>I need sleep and a long bath.</p>
<p>School is my main source of stress.</p>
 <p>To prove it here is my biology paper:</p>
  <p>Introduction
Conversion of substances and energy happens when something needs to be created. For the topic of genetics, this occurs during protein synthesis. For neurobiology, the conversion of substances and energy plays a more present role. A neuron cannot send an impulse without energy. Energy can neither be created nor destroyed; it can merely be converted into another form of energy. In this paper, we asked ourselves how necessary is the conversion of substances and energy in genetics and neurobiology? We then generated the hypothesis that the conversion of substances and energy is a crucial factor in genetics and neurobiology. Synthesis and energy metabolism are in a constant state of dynamic equilibrium, which is the state of balance between processes.
Lesson 1: Electricity and Evolution
In this lesson we were confronted with the question: “Will we all turn into cyborgs?” and although we will only discuss this in more depth next epoch, the question is not far-fetched. Our brain is a bunch of connections; it is interconnected. Ants and fungi have a very interconnected structure and why of communication which is brain-like as seen in the movie.  The Human Brain Project is a cutting-edge research project that’s the main goal is to advance our knowledge in the fields of neuroscience, computing and brain-related medicine. Development of the brain goes back millions of years. Living beings did not have nerves and therefore were not able to feel pain. The jellyfish is the first animal to develop a neural network. As time went on, animals have gotten more sophisticated. The development of the Cortex led to elaborate thinking.
When talking about energy, one can distinguish between several types of energy, for example; potential energy, mechanical energy and thermal energy. 
Luigi Galvani attached frog legs to electricity and let a current flow through them. The electric current resulted in the legs moving.
Electricity is the moving of charged carriers, either ions or electrons. 
In comparison to hormones (slow communication), electric information is fast.
Lesson 2: Neuron Structure
The human nervous system can be divided into two systems; the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The central nervous system entails the brain and spinal cord and the peripheral nervous system, the ganglia and nerves. 
The brain-blood barrier is a semipermeable border that separates the extracellular fluid from the central nervous system and the circulating blood from the brain.
Neurons, also known as nerve cells,  are very specialised cells. They are made out of a soma which contains all the usual components of a cell (nucleus, mitochondria, plasma, etc.) and neuron typical parts such as the dendrites, axon and synapse. The cell body is called a Soma; it integrates incoming signals and generates outgoing signals to the axon. Dendrites collect electric signals which transmit impulses away from the soma, and the axon is a transmitter; it passes an electric signal to the dendrites of another cell or an effector.  Neurons are surrounded by sheath cells (myelin; in vertebrates), also known as glial cells. Glial cells provide electric insulation, support and nutrition for the nerve cell.
Multiple sclerosis (MS) occurs when the immune system attacks the myelin that covers the nerve fibres, which causes communication problems between the brain and the body (Mayo Clinic, 2020).
Lesson 3: Membrane Potential 
The membrane potential is the voltage difference across the membrane. The axon membrane is made up of a double layer of lipids that separate the intercellular- and extracellular space. The membrane is selectively permeable. Meaning water molecules can pass through freely, but dissolved ions can only move in a restrictive manner. There are four primary ions: Na+, Cl-, K+, A-.
There are two types of membrane potential; resting and action potential. Generation of an action potential can be divided into four steps:
Resting potential: is at roughly -70 Millivolt. The extracellular space has a more positive charge than in the intracellular space, creating a concentration gradient. 
Depolarisation: the fast change in resting potential to a more positive voltage. 
Hyperpolarisation: voltage more negative than resting potential.
Repolarisation: returning to the resting potential.

Lesson 4: Synapse 
The synapse is the space between to neurons. It is made up of an enlarged axon terminal called a synaptic knob of the presynaptic cell, a synaptic cleft and a neighbouring cell (postsynaptic cell). This signal is mostly chemically transferred in the synaptic cleft, a signal from the presynaptic cell gets transferred to the postsynaptic cell. The chemical signals get transferred with neurotransmitters which are found in synaptic vesicles within the presynaptic cell. The neurotransmitters bind to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane allowing ion channels to open. Enzyms break the neurotransmitters down into their main components and bring them back into the presynaptic cell for reuse. An example of a neurotransmitter is acetylcholine.
Synaptic potentials
Lesson 5: Neurotoxins/Neuroenhancers
Toxins such as Black widow toxin and Botulinum toxin cause a  change in acetylcholine release. Botulinum toxin degrades a protein within the synaptic vesicles, thus inhibiting the release of acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft. Black widow toxin, however, stimulates the release of all the synaptic vessels into the synaptic cleft. 
Coniine blocks the acetylcholine receptor. This blockage leads to death by respiratory paralysis.
Atropine
Tubocurarine
Antidote 
Neuroenhancers are used to increase learning performance. In the documentary:” Take your pills” illustrates the increasing pressure on students to consume such brain boosters because they feel as if they are at a disadvantage if not consumed. The two main brain boasters are the ADHD medication; Adderall and Ritalin. Ritalin blocks the reuptake of dopamine into the presynaptic cell. Allowing more dopamine to be available and flow through the postsynaptic cell. Adderall, however, replaces dopamine in the presynaptic cell allowing more dopamine to be present in the synaptic cleft. The effect of brain boosters are only present when one is tired but being well-rested is more effective. This observation leads to the conclusion that one should not take these drugs but sleep instead. 
Lesson 6: Senses and Reflexes
Lesson 7: Sight
Different from other sensory organs, the eye continually fires impulses when light is absent. Light is a photo electromagnetic wave. We need two things to see; physical stimuli (light) and photoreceptors which send a neural impulse. Light enters the eye and hits the retina. The retina has specialised cells to process light and darkness (rods) and cells to see colour (cones). When light enters the eye, it triggers a phototransduction cascade. The rods get turned off, which then activates the bipolar cells, which turn the ganglion cells which sends an impulse through the optic nerve that goes to the brain.
Lesson 8: Repetition 
Discussion
At the beginning of our paper, we formulated the question: “How important is the conversion of substances and energy in genetics and neurobiology?” and generated the hypothesis: “The conversion of substances and energy is a key factor in genetics and neurobiology.” The results show that the conversion of substances and energy, also known as metabolism plays a crucial factor in genetics, neurobiology and many other processes in the body, starting from the consumption of fats, carbohydrates and proteins as a form of nutrients that can then be converted into ATP. Not only can proteins be converted into ATP but more importantly broken down into amino acids which are the building blocks for new proteins. Well, when are new proteins generated? Proteins are synthesised in DNA translation and transcription, which plays a vital role in our bodies. Proteins are the building blocks of the body. There are twenty different amino acids used to maintain and build structures in the body, such as the organ-like muscles. Proteins are made of amino acids that are used to make enzymes and membrane-bound receptors and transporters. For DNA replication, translation and transcription, there are different essential proteins such as RNA-Polymerase, mRNA, tRNA and ribosomes. Also, without the conversion of substances and energy would the synthesis of these enzymes not be possible and that, in turn, would mean that the replication of DNA, translation and transcription of DNA into RNA and later proteins would be impossible. Without energy DNA replication, translation and transcription cannot take place because for protein synthesis energy in the form of ATP needs to be used. Think of it as trying to buy groceries without money or drive a car without fuel. Our “money or fuel” is called ATP and is used as an energy source for some enzymes to initiate and sustain DNA replication. Meaning that the conversion of substances and energy plays a key if not a crucial factor in genetics. 
A crucial role in neurobiology is the conversion of energy and substances  Organisms need ATP to generate an action potential. Sodium-potassium pumps use energy delivered by ATP. If the Sodium-potassium pumps cannot regulate the concentration gradient of the axon membrane, no impulse can be sent. Another critical factor in the transmission of neural signals is the breaking down and the generation of neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters are the key players in turning an electrical signal into a chemical signal.</p>
